# products

The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of this project.

 
The `manuscript` folder contains a template. This template is structured as a report for a class.
Inside this folder, we have a supplementary folder where we shall place all the supplementary materials like figures, tables or even papers.


Since the manuscript comes with citations, we have placed all the refereces in the assets folder.
