# code

This folder and sub-folders should contain all my code and data cleaning process.The folder has both R files and Quarto files in it. The R scripts have the code that generated most of the graphs figures and tables.  
For analysis, we used an R script and everything was documented there.

The scripts also load the appropriate data (that is raw data), perform actions, and save results in the appropriate folders results folders. 

The scripts are documentated and commented to give you a step by step process of how we generated everything in the manuscript.
